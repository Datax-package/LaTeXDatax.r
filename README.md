# LaTeXDatax

An R plugin for [the datax LaTeX package[ctan]](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/datax).

Allows data to be saved in a form easily accessible from LaTeX.

## Status

This package is under sporadic development -- I am not confident enough in R
to publish this package on CRAN or anything.

Suggestions and pull requests welcome.
